<h3>What's new?</h3>

<p>
	<strong>~ Workaround for Google indexing temporary URLs which are NOT in href or src attributes</strong>.
	See https://github.com/akeeba/engage/discussions/310. We use prototype URLs for comment admin actions. These are
	passed to the frontend using Joomla's script options, which places them in a JSON document embedded in the HTML
	output of the page. Apparently, Google scans this document (even though it really shouldn't!), and indexes these
	URLs. There is no way to tell Google or any search engine to not index stuff in the JSON document they should not
	be parsing to begin with, therefore we can only do the one reasonable thing: base64-encode these URLs, and decode
	them in the frontend JavaScript code. This works, at the expense of transparency and performance.
