<h3>What's new?</h3>

<p>
	<strong>Do not email Comment Managers for spam messages by default</strong>. Previous versions of Akeeba Engage would send emails to comment managers for all messages, including those marked as possible spam. Only messages marked as definite spam by a plugin, e.g. the Akismet integration, would not result in an email. This was problematic for sites receiving a lot of spam. This version no longer sends email for any message marked as possible spam. You can change this behaviour by editing the "Akeeba Engage ‚Äì Emails" plugin and setting "Notify Comment Managers about spam comments" to Yes.

	<strong>Update CliRouting helper for Joomla! 5</strong>. URLs generated by CLI commands may be incorrect under Joomla! 5. This change fixes this behaviour.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Workaround for Google indexing temporary URLs which are NOT in href or src attributes</strong>. Google is overstepping while indexing your site, including URLs which are not in href or src attributes of elements, but solely appear in the embedded JSON document generated by Joomla's frontend options code. This caused Google to try index the template URLs for user interactive features such as publishing / unpublishing comments, marking comments as spam, replying to comments etc. Since these template URLs are invalid it resulted in a high rate of 404 errors reported for your site. In this version we are doing something stupid but effective: we encode these template URLs with base64 so that Google's indexing bot cannot "see" them. It is very simplistic, but it works. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

<p>
	<strong>Adding datePublished microdata alongside dateCreated</strong> [(gh-313)](https://github.com/akeeba/engage/issues/313). Google expects the publish date of each comment to be tagged as <code>datePublished</code>, otherwise it spits out a validation error. The default output has been changed to rectify this. If you are using a template override please apply the changes to your override.
